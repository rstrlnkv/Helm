## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Keep Awake module** — prevent sleep manually, by timer (presets + custom
  minutes with a live countdown), or automatically when an external display or
  power is connected, or when chosen apps run. Optional "keep display on",
  pointer jiggle, closed-lid (clamshell) mode via `pmset`, battery guard, a
  global toggle hotkey, and a configurable menu-bar tint color.
- **VPN module** — connect/disconnect system VPNs (`scutil`), per-app
  auto-connect rules, and silent L2TP/IPSec connect via a one-time keychain
  read cached in Helm's own keychain.
- **Menu-bar panel** — Control Center-style, per-module tiles, screen-edge
  clamping, quick automation toggles in a popover.
- **Settings** — System Settings-style window (AppKit split view), per-module
  enable switches, menu-bar icon shape/size, launch at login.
- **Liquid Glass app icon** built with Icon Composer.
- **Localization** — English, 中文, Español, Français, Deutsch, 日本語,
  Русский, Português.
