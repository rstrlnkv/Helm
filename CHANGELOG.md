# Changelog

All notable changes to Helm are documented here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow SemVer.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-24

### Added
- **GitHub updates** — Helm checks the public repo's latest release once a day
  and from Settings → General → Updates, surfacing a download link when a newer
  version is out.
- **What's New** — About → "What's New" renders this changelog in-app; About now
  shows the version, build number, and enabled-module count.
- **Keep Awake module** — prevent sleep manually, by timer (presets + custom
  minutes with a live countdown), or automatically when an external display or
  power is connected, or when chosen apps run. Optional "keep display on",
  pointer jiggle, closed-lid (clamshell) mode via `pmset`, battery guard, a
  global toggle hotkey, and a configurable menu-bar tint color.
- **VPN module** — connect/disconnect system VPNs (`scutil`), per-app
  auto-connect rules, and silent L2TP/IPSec connect via a one-time keychain
  read cached in Helm's own keychain.
- **Menu-bar panel** — Control Center-style, per-module tiles, screen-edge
  clamping, quick automation toggles in a popover.
- **Settings** — System Settings-style window (AppKit split view), per-module
  enable switches, menu-bar icon shape/size, launch at login.
- **Liquid Glass app icon** built with Icon Composer.
- **Localization** — English, 中文, Español, Français, Deutsch, 日本語,
  Русский, Português.
