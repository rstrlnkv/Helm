///   it, `HelmSurface.barPick`.
/// - `liquidGlass` — named for the system's own glass.
///
/// **The key is its own, and it is not `appearance`.** That key, in the same
/// namespace, already holds light, dark or the system's choice
/// (`AppAppearance`); a second meaning under a deployed key would read one
/// setting's value as the other's.
///
/// **Unknown reads flat.** `init(stored:)` answers `.flat` for nothing stored
/// and for any spelling it does not know, so a case retired later, or a value
/// written by a newer build, still reads as a look that exists.
///
/// **Not sealed:** nothing unattended reads it (`AppSettings.barAppearance`).
